# CampusVoice
A scalable web platform that enables students to raise campus complaints virtually, track resolution status, and improve transparency between students and administration.
📌 Project Name: CampusVoice

CampusVoice is a scalable, cloud-based web platform designed to solve real-world
campus problems by providing a centralized virtual complaint management system.

In many colleges, student complaints related to infrastructure, hostels, academics,
safety, and campus facilities are either handled manually or ignored due to lack
of transparency and proper tracking.

CampusVoice empowers students to:
- Raise complaints digitally
- Attach image/video evidence
- Track complaint status
- Experience fair and transparent resolution

The system is designed to handle 1000–5000 concurrent users initially within a
single campus and can scale to support multiple colleges with significantly
higher traffic in the future.

Key Features:
- Virtual complaint submission
- Media-supported complaints
- Role-based dashboards
- Auto-moderation and user blocking
- Scalable cloud architecture
- Secure and performance-optimized system

This project was developed as part of a hackathon with a strong focus on
social impact, scalability, and real-world feasibility.
